# Homework 4: Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe -- child's play, right?  You probably know that perfectly played games will always result in a draw.  In this assignment you will implement a computer's strategy for the game.

You will play against a random player -- a "monkey."  Let's call him Harry.  Since Harry plays randomly, you will beat him most of the time.  But here's the thing: he's going to pull a lot of antics things you might not expect, and you can _never_ lose.  You will each start about half the matches.

## The problem, formally defined.
